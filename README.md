## mijn use case

### To improve or present an alternative to Closed Captions / subtitles.

04-08 kickoff! during our online lecture we got seperated into groups to be coupled with someone experiencing difficulties using web applications due to a disability of some sort.

I got coupled with Marie van Driesschen, who works with the VPRO as a UX designer, enjoys watching series such as The Bridge and Friends and enjoys watching kickboxing / cooking videos.

### getting to meet Marie

Marie is Deaf, with a capital D which means she identifies with a smaller culture which acknowledges sign language to be their native language, this does not mean they consider themselves to be handicapped.

I got to ask a couple of questions in an online meeting together with the other students who had been assigned to Marie we spoke using Bongo with the help of her two tolks who translated her gestures to us and our questions to her (it worked surprisingly well!):

1. *What do you imagine when closed captions read [scary music] i imagine not being able to hear anything for the majority of your life means you have no idea what you're ment to expect.

> Coen (one of the other students) also had this question and was able to ask her before me, Marie smiled and explained that while she does understand the concept and can imagine what [birds chirping] would "sound" like that this is indeed one of many things deaf people cant really form a mental model around.

2. *Given that subtitles are usually just plain white lines of text, is it hard for you to distunguish between which character is talking or not?

> Marie nods while i posed the question: It is sometimes very difficult indeed, aspecially when characters are out of focus, she later tells me that she thinks the solution Teletekst used to provide (adding nameplates to the subtitles they belong to) might indeed have been a good solution for platforms like netflix...

3. *Expanding on the previous question i asked Marie if she finds it annoying to be able to read entire sentences beofre the characters have even spoken them in the actual image.

> Marie told us that the most annoying part is when the subtitles are not synched up correctly with the show, while i think this is more of a technical command it does pull into question wether subtitles are better off popping up word by word...

4. *Expanding on Marie telling Gijs (another one of the students) that she does not enjoy scary movies that much i wondered how she is able to enjoy one of her favorite series Friends! considering the amount of sarcasm and timing in punchlines.

> A conversation followed in which we talked about the dutch language is a very "sarcastic" language and i wondered if the reason she preferred english subtitles was because otherwise some context might be lost required to understand the joke. Marie enjoys reading english subtitles because its directly translated from english and not altered in any way which led me to believe there is no correlation between her prefering english subtitles and her hearing disability.

### some other interesting things from the Q&A

- Subitles can be bland, theres no intonation in ityou can only read someones emotion looking at their face or assuming their reactions (this becomes even more difficult if the person speaking is out of focus).

- Marie has seen "New Kids on the Block" recently and really injoyed the captions/subtitles it had, the subtitles read Jonguh instead of jongen so she could imagine how stupid that might have come across.

- The Parasite: A movie awarded for its use of music and sound, Marie gave us this recomendation as a tip to look at.

- Joan asked if there are any specific things she dislikes about the current way media platforms handle CC/subtitles, Marie told us she hates automatically generated captions, they are very inaccurate.

- Mohamad showed Marie a sketch of his idea and what his solution for experiencing podcasts would be, she was worried it might be too much to look at.

- Marie uses an app called Doventolk App on which she can ask someone who understands sign language to serve as a middle man between her and whoever she is calling. In her lecture on the following day after this Q&A she explained that even using this app she encounters difficulties such as having to consent to agreements verbally and not being able to let her tolk give consent for her.

### Maries lecture 04-09

The following day Marie spoke briefly about things she encountered and misconceptions content creators and everyday people have with people who identify as "Deaf".
