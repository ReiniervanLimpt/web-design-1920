## mijn use case

### To improve or present an alternative to Closed Captions / subtitles.

04-08 kickoff! during our online lecture we got seperated into groups to be coupled with someone experiencing difficulties using web applications due to a disability of some sort.

I got coupled with Marie van Driesschen, who works with the VPRO as a UX designer, enjoys watching series such as The Bridge and Friends and enjoys watching kickboxing / cooking videos.

### getting to meet Marie

Marie is Deaf, with a capital D which means she identifies with a smaller culture which acknowledges sign language to be their native language, this does not mean they consider themselves to be handicapped.

I got to ask a couple of questions in an online meeting together with the other students who had been assigned to Marie we spoke using Bongo with the help of her two tolks who translated her gestures to us and our questions to her (it worked surprisingly well!):

1. *What do you imagine when closed captions read [scary music] i imagine not being able to hear anything for the majority of your life means you have no idea what you're ment to expect.

> Coen (one of the other students) also had this question and was able to ask her before me, Marie smiled and explained that while she does understand the concept and can imagine what [birds chirping] would "sound" like that this is indeed one of many things deaf people cant really form a mental model around.

2. *Given that subtitles are usually just plain white lines of text, is it hard for you to distunguish between which character is talking or not?

> Marie nods while i posed the question: It is sometimes very difficult indeed, aspecially when characters are out of focus, she later tells me that she thinks the solution Teletekst used to provide (adding nameplates to the subtitles they belong to) might indeed have been a good solution for platforms like netflix...

3. *Expanding on the previous question i asked Marie if she finds it annoying to be able to read entire sentences beofre the characters have even spoken them in the actual image.

> Marie told us that the most annoying part is when the subtitles are not synched up correctly with the show, while i think this is more of a technical command it does pull into question wether subtitles are better off popping up word by word...

4. *Expanding on Marie telling Gijs (another one of the students) that she does not enjoy scary movies that much i wondered how she is able to enjoy one of her favorite series Friends! considering the amount of sarcasm and timing in punchlines.

> A conversation followed in which we talked about the dutch language is a very "sarcastic" language and i wondered if the reason she preferred english subtitles was because otherwise some context might be lost required to understand the joke. Marie enjoys reading english subtitles because its directly translated from english and not altered in any way which led me to believe there is no correlation between her prefering english subtitles and her hearing disability.

### some other interesting things from the Q&A

- Subitles can be bland, theres no intonation in ityou can only read someones emotion looking at their face or assuming their reactions (this becomes even more difficult if the person speaking is out of focus).

- Marie has seen "New Kids on the Block" recently and really injoyed the captions/subtitles it had, the subtitles read Jonguh instead of jongen so she could imagine how stupid that might have come across.

- The Parasite: A movie awarded for its use of music and sound, Marie gave us this recomendation as a tip to look at.

- Joan asked if there are any specific things she dislikes about the current way media platforms handle CC/subtitles, Marie told us she hates automatically generated captions, they are very inaccurate.

- Mohamad showed Marie a sketch of his idea and what his solution for experiencing podcasts would be, she was worried it might be too much to look at.

- Marie uses an app called Doventolk App on which she can ask someone who understands sign language to serve as a middle man between her and whoever she is calling. In her lecture on the following day after this Q&A she explained that even using this app she encounters difficulties such as having to consent to agreements verbally and not being able to let her tolk give consent for her.

### Maries lecture 04-09

The following day Marie spoke briefly about things she encountered and misconceptions content creators and everyday people have with people who identify as "Deaf".

Sign language is 4 dimensional language, it takes up time and space during movements.

A tolk "lends" their voice to the person who needs them, they dont speak for them.

## What i mean to be focussing on in designing my prototype for the second test round

:star: I showed Marie an example of how i wish to improve on CC for people with a hearing diability, she was happy to see i used a snippet of one of her favorite shows! Marie asked me to replay the example 3 times, she was struggling to understand what some of the animations i used for text were meant to illustrate.

- [x] Emphasizing intonation of characters.
From my conversation with marie i deduced its hard to "see" or read if a character is being sarcastic, annoyed or surprised.

> :exclamation: During the second test round marie said she would like to see some character specific characteristics, i showed her an example where Ross from friends said "carl" in a very monotone annoyed way, i tried to convey this by stretching out the word slowly but Marie could not make out what i was trying to illustrate.

- [x] Show which character is talking with icons or letters??
The usual white lines of text do not show which character is talking, Marie does not have the luxury of hearing the voice of a character so i need to find a way to work around this problem.

> :exclamation: I showed an example in which the character speaking was showed by the letter shown in the bottom left, Ross would be *R* and rachel would be *Ra*, Marie was able to make out who was talking.

> :exclamation: I did not get to show Marie what the CC would look like when a character is out of focus, i need to work on that.

## working on my last prototype

In my previous testing round i did not get to show what would happen if a character was speaking while out of focus, Marie allso said some of the animations i used on text raised some eyebrows.

In my final prototype i worked on trying to create the illusion of space outside of the current viewbox, i did this by:

### adding dots to show where every character is currently located in the room (nonsense)

> Marie did not seem to think alot of these dots, she was more interested in the colors i used and thought i could make use of them in another way

### flashing lights if a character is talking while out of focus

> Marie was confused, she asked me to repeat the section a couple of times because she was unsure what she was looking at.

> :star: Marie commented that she was unsure about the text becoming more visible once the character "spoke" those words, she later commented that she actually DID enjoy the effect (being able to read the sentence and also knowing how and when the character spoke them)
